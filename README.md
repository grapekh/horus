Network Explorer for Miners

Go Lang Program for walking the network and look for miners. 
Nothing exciting yet,  but just wait....

The API for sgminer is: |https://github.com/sgminer-dev/sgminer/blob/master/doc/API.md
This is interesting, as it is just a little different from the cgminer API, but close
Innosilicon is using the sgminer, bitmail is using the cgminer. 

Need to make the code smart - do a connect, check to see what / etc. then do the needful.
