Network Explorer for Miners

Go Lang Program for walking the network and look for miners. 
Nothing exciting yet,  but just wait....

The API for sgminer is: |https://github.com/sgminer-dev/sgminer/blob/master/doc/API.md
I also found an api for cgminer: https://godoc.org/github.com/Nitron/go-cgminer-api
This is interesting, as they are both different ... but close
Innosilicon is using the sgminer, bitmail is using the cgminer I think
Need to get this to be completely generic.... more to come

Need to make the code smart - do a connect, check to see what / etc. then do the needful.
